  <p>
    Throughout the original Star Wars trilogy, many interesting planets and moons are the settings of the movies. Just like in our own galaxy, the planets and moons of the Star Wars galaxy are all different from each other and each has their own climates and organisms. Each section of this site will explore a planet or moon seen in the original trilogy. Happy travels!
