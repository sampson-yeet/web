    Star Wars is one of my favorite film franchises ever. While much of what makes Star Wars special when it was released came from its special effects and its storytelling, one aspect of it that managed to keep me captivated through the films was the planets. It was interesting seeing how one planet differed from another and how each planet was home to unique organisms. The purpose of this website is to give descriptions of four planets seen throughout the original Star Wars trilogy. While I am by no means an expert in Star Wars planets, I have seen the films enough times to give a hopefully somewhat accurate details about each planet. I hope you enjoy this journey across the Star Wars galaxy!
