  <p>
    Tatooine is the planet that started the entire Star Wars franchise. The planet, once the home planet of Luke and Anakin Skywalker, is a desert planet orbitting twin suns, Tatoo I and Tatoo II. While the planet once had a moderate climate with rainforests and oceans, it has been a desert planet for the entirety of the franchise and only a small part of the planet is inhabitable. The planet is plagued by many dangers including, but not limited to criminal activities and sandstorms. For a long time, slavery, smuggling, and attacks by <a href="https://www.starwars.com/databank/tusken-raiders">Tusken Raiders</a> were all common and were threats to inhavitants of the desert planet. However, despite its unattractiveness, its interestingness is not in the planet itself but in the people who escape from it.
