  Bespin is a <a href="https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/what-is-an-exoplanet/planet-types/gas-giant/">gas giant</a> first seen in The Empire Strikes Back. It is a source of tibanna gas, a fuel used for production and transport. Because most of the planet is filled with poisonous gas, humans cannot survive on most of the planet, but there is a layer of the planet that is suitable for human life due to the presence of oxygen and a proper temperature and pressure. This layer is where the famous Cloud City is located. Cloud City is a floating colony that hovers above Bespin that is home to millions of people while also serving as a popular tourist attraction As Bespin is a major source of tibanna gas, much of Cloud City's population works in mining and processing gas.
