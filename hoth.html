<h1>Hoth</h1>
  <p>
    Hoth is first seen in <a href="https://www.starwars.com/films/star-wars-episode-v-the-empire-strikes-back">The Empire Strikes Back</a>. It is the sixth planet in the Hoth star system. Because of its remoteness, its climate is dominated by snow and freezing temperatures. This inhospitable climate prevented the emergence of intelligent life although the planet is still home to several species of animals. Amongst these are tauntauns and wampas. Tauntauns are large, gray snow lizards that served as a mode of transport for the Rebel Alliance during their stay on the planet. Wampas bear a strong resemblance to yetis and are the apex predators of the planet because of their towering figures.
