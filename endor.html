<p>
    Endor is first seen in <a href="https://www.starwars.com/films/star-wars-episode-vi-return-of-the-jedi">Return of the Jedi</a>. The moon, home to a variety of lifeforms, orbits the planet Endor. The geography of the moon is mostly composed of dense woodands, tall mountains, and savannas, not dissimilar to rainforests on Earth. The moon is home to very tall trees with some of them even surpassing 1000 meters in height. One animal species the moon is home to is Ewoks; Ewoks are furry, sentient creatures that had established their own unique culture within tribal groups. The Ewoks are most known for their involvement in the Battle of Endor by helping the Rebel Alliance achieve victory against the Galactic Empire.
