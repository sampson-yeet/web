  <h2>Hoth</h2>
  <p>
    Hoth is first seen in <a href="https://www.starwars.com/films/star-wars-episode-v-the-empire-strikes-back">The Empire Strikes Back</a>. It is the sixth planet in the Hoth star system. Because of its remoteness, its climate is dominated by snow and freezing temperatures. This inhospitable climate prevented the emergence of intelligent life although the planet is still home to several species of animals. Amongst these are tauntauns and wampas. Tauntauns are large, gray snow lizards that served as a mode of transport for the Rebel Alliance during their stay on the planet. Wampas bear a strong resemblance to yetis and are the apex predators of the planet because of their towering figures.

  <h2>Return of the Jedi</h2>
  <p>
    In <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/star_wars_episode_vi_return_of_the_jedi">Return of the Jedi</a>, Luke finds himself in confrontation with his father Darth Vader and the Emperor Darth Sidious. Darth Sidious, being the despicable maniac he is, laughs maniacally as he electrocutes Luke with his Force Lighting. As Luke cries out in pain, he begs Vader to help him. Vader unexpectingly grabs his master and tosses Sidious down a hole while being electrocuted. With his last breaths, he requests LUke to help him take off his helmet. Luke is reluctant because he does not wnat his father to die. However, Vader assures him that he will die either way and so Vader gets to look at his son with his own eyes before he dies. Meanwhile, the Rebels had been fighting on the forest planet of Endor and they eventually won. This movie marked the end of the Galactic Empire as well as Luke's character arc.
