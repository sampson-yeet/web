  <h2>Hoth</h2>
  <p>
    Hoth is first seen in <a href="https://www.starwars.com/films/star-wars-episode-v-the-empire-strikes-back">The Empire Strikes Back</a>. It is the sixth planet in the Hoth star system. Because of its remoteness, its climate is dominated by snow and freezing temperatures. This inhospitable climate prevented the emergence of intelligent life although the planet is still home to several species of animals. Amongst these are tauntauns and wampas. Tauntauns are large, gray snow lizards that served as a mode of transport for the Rebel Alliance during their stay on the planet. Wampas bear a strong resemblance to yetis and are the apex predators of the planet because of their towering figures.

  <h2>Endor</h2>
  <p>
    Endor is first seen in <a href="https://www.starwars.com/films/star-wars-episode-vi-return-of-the-jedi">Return of the Jedi</a>. The moon, home to a variety of lifeforms, orbits the planet Endor. The geography of the moon is mostly composed of dense woodands, tall mountains, and savannas, not dissimilar to rainforests on Earth. The moon is home to very tall trees with some of them even surpassing 1000 meters in height. One animal species the moon is home to is Ewoks; Ewoks are furry, sentient creatures that had established their own unique culture within tribal groups. The Ewoks are most known for their involvement in the Battle of Endor by helping the Rebel Alliance achieve victory against the Galactic Empire.

  <h2>Tatooine</h2>
  <p>
    Tatooine is the planet that started the entire Star Wars franchise. The planet, once the home planet of Luke and Anakin Skywalker, is a desert planet orbitting twin suns, Tatoo I and Tatoo II. While the planet once had a moderate climate with rainforests and oceans, it has been a desert planet for the entirety of the franchise and only a small part of the planet is inhabitable. The planet is plagued by many dangers including, but not limited to criminal activities and sandstorms. For a long time, slavery, smuggling, and attacks by <a href="https://www.starwars.com/databank/tusken-raiders">Tusken Raiders</a> were all common and were threats to inhavitants of the desert planet. However, despite its unattractiveness, its interestingness is not in the planet itself but in the people who escape from it.
