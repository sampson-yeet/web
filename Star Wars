  <h2>The Empire Strikes Back</h2>
  <p>
    The Empire Strikes Back is a direct sequel to Star Wars 1977 was released in 1980. <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/empire_strikes_back">TESB</a> This film has a much darker tone than the original Star Wars because the Rebel Alliance does not win a single battle in this one which contrasts with their endless victories in A New Hope. The movie focuses on Luke Skywalker as he travels to a swamp planet to train with the Jedi Master Yoda to further conenct with the Force. Meanwhile, the nefarious Darth Vader learns that Luke is his son and decides to lure him into Cloud City to convert him to the Dark Side of the Force. When Luke does go to Cloud City, he gets his hand cut off and in a shocking moment, Vader reveals to him that he is Luke's father that Obi-Wan claims Vader had killed. In addition to this, the Rebels had also lost the Battle of Hoth and had Han Solo captured and frozen. It seemed as if the Rebel Alliance had lost.

  <h2>Return of the Jedi</h2>
  <p>
    In Return of the Jedi <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/star_wars_episode_vi_return_of_the_jedi">ROTJ</a>, Luke finds himself in confrontation with his father Darth Vader and the Emperor Darth Sidious. Darth Sidious, being the despicable maniac he is, laughs maniacally as he electrocutes Luke with his Force Lighting. As Luke cries out in pain, he begs Vader to help him. Vader unexpectingly grabs his master and tosses Sidious down a hole while being electrocuted. With his last breaths, he requests LUke to help him take off his helmet. Luke is reluctant because he does not wnat his father to die. However, Vader assures him that he will die either way and so Vader gets to look at his son with his own eyes before he dies. Meanwhile, the Rebels had been fighting on the forest planet of Endor and they eventually won. This movie marked the end of the Galactic Empire as well as Luke's character arc.
